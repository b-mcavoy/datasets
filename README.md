# Data Tables
Clean datasets provided by code.org for use by students enrolled in AP Computer Science Principles.

Information about each dataset can be found on the readme for its subfolder. The link for each dataset goes to code.org's information page about that dataset, and those pages in turn link to the original source for the data.

### To import a dataset into your Repl.it project:
1. Download the utils.js file and upload it into your Repl.it project.
2. Click on the CSV file you want.
3. Click the button that says "Raw," then copy and save the URL for that page.
4. When you use the getColumn() function provided by utils.js, the URL you copied should be passed as the url parameter for the function.
